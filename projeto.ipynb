    "Devido ao horizonte de investimento relativamente curto — apenas dois anos — as diferenças de rentabilidade mensal entre os títulos avaliados tornam-se menos expressivas. Isso se deve, em parte, ao baixo volume aplicado, pois percentuais de retorno ganham maior relevância à medida que os valores envolvidos se tornam mais elevados, especialmente quando ultrapassam a casa dos milhões.\n",
    "\n",
    "O cálculo para converter a taxa de juros anual para mensal, foi utilizando a fórmula de equivalência de taxas de diferentes frequência. Posteriormente, foi feito apenas uma conta simples de juros compostos para saber quanto renderia o aporte ao final do contrato, visto que é uma única aplicação. O retorno líquido final é descontando o valor inicial aplicado e os impostos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outro ponto importante é que nenhum dos CDBs analisados cobra taxa de administração, o que contribui para um resultado mais transparente na comparação entre eles e todos são capitalizados mensalmente.\n",

    "Dessa forma, é possível destacar que o **Banco Original** oferece uma rentabilidade significativamente superior em relação aos demais. O **CDB do Banco ABC** também apresenta desempenho ligeiramente melhor que o da **Caixa Geral**, embora a diferença entre ambos seja pouco representativa.
